# WOLFforce-Revolt

[WIP]

WOLFforce Revolt is a reborn version of the Hera Project, a unique launcher for all WOLFforce modpacks, texture packs and shaders.

This time I wrote the application using electron, to provide more flexibility, a better (completely custom) UI, as well as a way easier way to port this application to Linux (and maybe macOS if really needed).
